# coding_challenge_bank

* For this coding challenge, I worked through part of user story 1 from the bank OCR coding challenge(https://www.bloc.io/users/benjamin-reinecke/checkpoints/2951?section=383).  In the 1.5 hours time I spent, I created 3 separate randomly generated 9 digit codes that I converted
to their pipe/underscore equivalents.  The next step, had I more time, would be to convert 500 of these randomly generated numbers into their pipe/underscore equivalents, write them to a file, then construct a parser to read them back into their associated numbers.

* Steps to run the application.  Fork and pull the entire repo to your machine, npm install, and npm start to run the application on the command line.
